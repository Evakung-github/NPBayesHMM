Some simple tips for my basic git workflow.

====================== BRANCHING
1) Create branch (and move into it all at once)
git checkout -b <bname>

2) See what branches exist
git branch

3) Switch into some existing branch
git checkout <bname>

======================= BRANCH w/ remote tracking
Remote tracking allows multiple devs/multiple computers to have access to the same branch.

1) Create the branch (locally)
git checkout -b <bname>

2) Commit to the remote server FOR THE FIRST TIME
git commit -a -m "My Message"
git push -u origin <bname>

3) Check out branch on remote machine
git checkout --track -b <bname> origin/<bname>

4) Commit+Push edits to the branch (on any machine) AT ANY TIME
git commit -a -m "My msg"
git push
