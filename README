NPBayesHMM : Nonparametric Bayesian HMM toolbox, for Matlab
Author:  Mike Hughes (mike@michaelchughes.com). 

This toolbox provides code for running Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior
inference for a variety of NPBayes models for sequential data.  Currently, only 
the Beta Process (BP) HMM is fully supported, but releases for HDP-HMM and other 
models are planned.

The repository is organized simply.  
  code/ contains relevant Matlab code. This should be the working dir in Matlab.
   .../demo/ in particular has some easy demo scripts.
  doc/  contains human-readable documentation, including some examples.
     
Look for additional documentation and occasional updates on github:
