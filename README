Please email all comments/questions to mike <AT> michaelchughes.com

This toolbox provides code for running Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior
inference for a variety of NPBayes models for sequential data.  Currently, only 
the Beta Process (BP) HMM is fully supported, but releases for HDP-HMM and other 
models are planned.

The repository is organized as follows:  
  code/ contains relevant Matlab code. This should be the working dir in Matlab.
        within code/, you can find a fast intro script in code/demo/EasyDemo.m
  doc/  contains human-readable documentation.
        QuickStartGuide.pdf in particular describes how to configure the code.
  data/ contains one example dataset (6 Mocap sequences of various exercises)
        See the demos for how to run posterior inference on this data. 
      
Look for additional documentation and occasional updates on github:

Acknowledgements:
This code is inspired by (and heavily based upon) the
BP-AR-HMM toolbox, released by Emily Fox. Most functions have been completely 
re-written for speed, readability, and extensibility, but Emily deserves most
credit for coming up with some original solid inference algorithms.

I also thank Tom Minka for his excellent Lightspeed toolbox, 
and the development team at Eigen for a blazingly-fast matrix library,
which made the HMM dynamic programming routines much much faster.
